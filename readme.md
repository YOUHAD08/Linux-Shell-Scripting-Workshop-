# 🐧 Linux Shell Scripting Workshop 

This workshop helped me get hands-on experience with writing and executing Bash scripts in a Linux environment.

### ✅ Here's what I did and learned:

- I created a working directory and wrote my **first Bash script** that prints a simple greeting.
- I learned how to make scripts **executable** using `chmod +x`.
- I worked with **variables** and made scripts interactive using the `read` command.
- I used **conditional statements** (`if`, `else`) to compare numbers and determine if a number is even or odd.
- I created **loops** using `for` to repeat actions, like displaying a multiplication table.
- I built a simple **automation script** to back up files into a user-specified directory.

These exercises helped me understand the structure of shell scripts and how they can be used to automate repetitive tasks in Linux.
